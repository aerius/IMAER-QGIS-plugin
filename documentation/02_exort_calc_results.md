# Export edited AERIUS Calculator results

## Introduction

After editing the imported AERIUS Calculator results, the plugin can export the data back to IMAER GML format.

## Howto

Select the layer with the (edited) Calculator results to enable the ![alt text](../ImaerPlugin/icon_import_calc_result.png "export button") button in the IMAER toolbar. Clicking the button will save a new GML file in the same directory as the source GML file used for the import. The filename will be `<old_file_name>_modified.gml`.

(Currently there is no functionality for choosing the file name.)
