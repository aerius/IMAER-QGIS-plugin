## Functionality

The current functionality covers:
* Generating AERIUS Calculator input from your own emission source layers
* Opening AERIUS Calculator results
* Performing calculations on Calculation result layers
* Performing operations on the AERIUS Connect API

## Installation

### From the QGIS plugin repository

The plugin is regularly updated in the QGIS plugin repository, so the easiest way
to install it is by using the Plugin Manager within QGIS. Currently you will need to
enable 'experimental plugins' to find it. The most recent plugin requires QGIS version
3.34.x or higher.

### From zip file

In case you want to use another version of the plugin than the most current in the QGIS plugin repository, you can download the desired plugin form github
[code](https://github.com/opengeogroep/AERIUS-QGIS-plugins/issues)
and install it with the Plugin Manager in QGIS ("Install from zip tab").

### From python code

Of course you can also clone the code from the github repository and install it
manually in QGIS.
