* Extracting GML data from AERIUS PDF files
* Performing calculations (+ and -) on IMAER layers
* Generating AERIUS Calculator input from your own emission source layers

## Issues

If you meet any issues with this plugin, please file a bug report on the
github issue [page](https://github.com/opengeogroep/AERIUS-QGIS-plugins/issues).
You can also suggest ideas for improvements or enhancements.

## Installation

The plugin is regularly published in the QGIS plugin repository, so the easiest way
to install it is by using the Plugin Manager within QGIS. Currently you will need to
enable 'experimental plugins' to find it.

Of course you can also clone the code from the github repository and install it
manually.
