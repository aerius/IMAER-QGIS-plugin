IMAER data.

## Functionality

The current functionality covers:
* Opening and editing AERIUS Calculator results
* Extracting GML data from AERIUS PDF files
* Generating AERIUS Calculator input from your own emission source layers
* Performing calculations on Calculation result layers
* Perform operations on the AERIUS Connect API

## Installation

### From QGIS Plugin Repository
The plugin is regularly updated in the QGIS plugin repository, so the easiest way
to install it is by using the Plugin Manager within QGIS. The plugin should work from
QGIS 3.30.x or higher, and is likely to work in older versions of QGIS but that has
not been tested.

### From zip file 
You can also install the plugin from a zip file using the `Install from ZIP` 
functionality in the Plugin Manager in QGIS.

Zip files can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/opengeogroep/AERIUS-QGIS-plugins/tree/master/releases).

### From source code
Of course you can also clone the code from the git repository from [github](https://github.com/opengeogroep/AERIUS-QGIS-plugins/tree/master/releases) and install manually in QGIS.
