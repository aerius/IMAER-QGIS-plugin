About
=====
This plug-in is developed by `OpenGeoGroep <http://www.opengeogroep.nl/>`_ in collaboration with the `AERIUS <https://www.aerius.nl/>`_ team. The plug-in reads IMAER gml output from the `AERIUS Calculator <https://calculator.aerius.nl/calculator/>`_. How this is done is explained in the :doc:`usage` section.

The plug-in is meant to be a demonstrator. So it does not have full functionality and is written to be easily extensible and adaptable (to eg. ArcGIS). How to extend or adapt this demonstrator is explained in the :doc:`developers` section.

More information about AERIUS and IMAER (Information Model AERIUS) can be found on https://www.aerius.nl .
