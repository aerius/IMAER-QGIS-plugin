General setup
=============
This plug in for QGIS is meant to be a demonstrator. It is designed to be easily extensible and adaptable. Therefore the plug-in is split in two main parts:

- the ``imaerread`` module which handles the import of IMAER gml
- the ``ImaerReader`` module which provides the QGIS user interface and receives data to the imaerread module


imaerread module
=================
The imaerread module reads IMAER gml on the basis of passed in data. The module can be imported and used stand alone. Therefore it provides a basis for extending GIS (or other) software with the capability to write valid IMAER gml. 

The module has no dependencies outside of the Python core libraries. Only generic Emission Sources are supported.

Basic usage
-----------
Writing IMAER gml from python by using the imaerwrite module is simple:

Start by importing the module::

    import imaerread

Create a reader object by providing an id and a geometry::

    ir = ImaerRead(gmlFile = 'filename.gml')
